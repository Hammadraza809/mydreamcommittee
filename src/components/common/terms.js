                            <li>Dream Committee may provide custodian, nominee, administrative or other services to any person and shall not in any circumstances be required to account to the Member for any connection therewith.

                            <li>Dream Committee is required by Rules to establish, implement and maintain conflicts of profit policy, which sets out the types of actual or potential conflicts of profit which may affect Dream Committee. A copy of this policy will be provided on request.</li>
